Forked from [Erik Demaine's Github](https://github.com/edemaine/fold)

Working on learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as computational origami.  
Heres a small example of what I've done so far: [Waterbomb Base Opening Iteration](https://abacusta.github.io/fold/examples/foldviewer.html)

I created a program to calculate the vertices of a waterbomb base based on the angle of opening.
