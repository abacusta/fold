This project is based on a fork from [Erik Demaine's FOLD Project on GitHub](https://github.com/edemaine/fold).

Working on learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through computational origami.  
Here's a small example of what I've done so far: [Waterbomb Base Opening Iteration](https://abacusta.github.io/fold/examples/foldviewer.html).

A program was created to calculate the vertices of a "waterbomb base" based on the angle of opening between the z-axis and the [1,4] edge. The fully folded form is at 0<sup>o</sup> while the crease pattern is at 90<sup>o</sup>. A slider will be added to simulate opening the angle smoothly from 0<sup>o</sup> to 180<sup>o</sup>. The latter will correspond to a fully inverted closed form.
