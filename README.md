Forked from [Erik Demaine's FOLD Project on GitHub](https://github.com/edemaine/fold)

Working on learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through computational origami.  
Here's a small example of what I've done so far: [Waterbomb Base Opening Iteration](https://abacusta.github.io/fold/examples/foldviewer.html)

A program was created to calculate the vertices of a waterbomb base based on the angle of opening with respect to the axis perpendicular to the intersection of all the creases.
I would like to add a slider to make adjusting the angle smoother and more visually appealing.
